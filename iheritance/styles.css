/*
TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Set a global font-family for the entire page and make all text inherit it.
2. Change the text color of .container to dark blue and make all its child elements inherit it.
3. Override the inherited text color in .content to a black color (don't explicitly set it to black color rather use one of the value from inherit, initial, unset or revert to do this)
4. Ensure the <h1> inside .container has a specific color (e.g., red) that overrides the inherited one.
5. Give .nested a 4px solid maroon border and check if its child <p> elements inherit it. If they don’t, ensure they inherit the border from their .nested parent
6. The <p> elements inside .content should have the default text color but the one inside .nested should have a red color with a yellow background.
